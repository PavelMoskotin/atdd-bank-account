<h1>Viewing a Balance Slip</h1>

<p>Our customer's are going to want to see their current balance.</p>

<p>The system should therefore be able to respond with a customer's current balance at the point in time they request it.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<div class="example">
<p>A customer Dale has an account with a balance of <code>1045.00 EUR</code>.</p>

<p>Dale checks his balance.</p>

<p>The system reports back the correct balance (along with the current date and time).</p>
