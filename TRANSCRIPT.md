# Customer Interview

Conducted between yourselves (the development team) and Sarah (the product owner). Sarah is a key sponsor here, it's her vision of what an online retail bank should look like that's shaping the future of the company. She's often terse if her descriptions of that vision, so sometimes, you have to work hard to make sure you come away with the same understanding as her. 

She often puts herself in the position of the actual customer - the person using your online only banking services. Be aware that she's really a proxy to the _real_ customer.

LOCATION: YOUR SWANKY STARTUP OFFICE IN THE HEART OF THE SILICONE ROUNDABOUT

**YOU** (Developer)  
"Thanks for meeting Sarah, Geoff tells us you have some new requirements. Want to tell me more?"  

**SARAH** (Product Owner)  
"Hey, great. Yes. So we've got the basics going for the retail account but I suddenly realised that no one's going to want to sign up if they can't see their running transactions..."  

**YOU**  
"Ah, sure. Makes sense."  

**SARAH**    
"So, I'm thinking we need a fancy statement view on the UI. You know, on mobile devices, the website maybe via SMS... (her gaze wonders into the middle distance)"  

**YOU**  
"Er, ok... sounds straight forward. You'd like a statement view on recent transactions?"  

**SARAH**  
"Er, what? Year, sure."  

**YOU**  
"So what are you thinking by "recent"? Do you think the last few weeks? A months worth of data?"  

**SARAH**  
(looking on her mobile, you suspect she's playing Flappy Bird) 

**YOU**  
"How about the content of the statement? I think I can probably guess the basics but what do you think should be displayed?"  

**SARAH**  
"Yeah, obviously the basics."  

**YOU**  
(Stares blankly)

**SARAH**  
"oh, and the address..."  

**YOU**  
"Postal address?"  

**SARAH**  
"Yes"  

**YOU**  
"Ok, of the customer?"  

**SARAH**  
"And maybe any interest accrued. And it's got to look pretty. And have some dates on it."  

**YOU**  
"Ok, interest payments, deposits, withdraws, transaction dates and some meta data about the account or customer?"  

(Sarah's phone rings

**SARAH**  
"I have to take this but you've got the basics right? Sorry I have to dash (it's the VC) but I'm very happy to work iteratively using acceptance tests. That works great last time. See ya."  

**YOU**  
"Oh, Ok, thanks. Bye."  

**SARAH**  
(On her way out, she pokes her head back through the door)
"Oh, and by the way, do you think we can use Blockchain for this? Bye"  

**YOU**
