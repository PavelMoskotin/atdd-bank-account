# Acceptance Testing a Bank Account

You are part of the development team responsible for building out a new online retail bank offering. In a [previous session](https://github.com/xp-dojo/tdd-bank-account-java), you built out basic account functions like depositing and withdrawing funds. Now, the product owner wants to build out the next phase making the offering more appealing to those customers just waiting to sign up.


# Prerequisites

You will need Java and an IDE.

1. Clone the repository with the following command.

   `git clone https://github.com/xp-dojo/atdd-bank-account`
  
   If you have problems with SSL, you can try the following.
   
   `git clone -c http.sslVerify=false https://github.com/xp-dojo/atdd-bank-account`
   
   If you have problems with a proxy, you can `unset http_proxy` and `unset https_proxy` (or equivalent for your OS).

1. Open the project from IntelliJ IDEA (community edition is fine). 


# Instructions

This session is all about working with your customers (in this case the product owner) to understand their requirements and writing acceptance tests that you can show them to make sure you've understood them correctly and they're happy with what you're building. Just like the TDD session, you should write your acceptance tests *before* the implementation and think about small, iterative development cycles.

> Iterative vs incremental development: do you know the difference? Ask an instructor if you're not sure.
